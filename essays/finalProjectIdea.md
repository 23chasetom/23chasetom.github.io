The Problem:
Communication within universities like UH Manoa is often lacking and messy. Students, faculty, and clubs rely on various platforms, from email, Discord, Instagram, and word-of-mouth to share announcements, organize events, create activities, etc. At some point, managing and constantly checking each platform gets tedious. As a result, students frequently miss important updates, or struggle to stay involved with the university community.

Essentially, there is no unified space where official campus updates, social engagement, and student discussions coexist.

The Solution:
ManoaNet is an all-in-one campus communication and engagement platform that connects students, clubs, classes, and faculty through a verified university network.

The platform enables users to stay informed with official announcements and daily updates, communicate through live chats and discussion posts, promote and discover events, collaborate in class and club spaces, and manage personal activities, all in one integrated system.



Approach:
The application will create a verified social ecosystem exclusive for each university.
Students, faculty, and clubs can join via official school emails to ensure verification.

Some possible mockup pages:
Landing Page – Introduces ManoaNet and highlights its purpose as a unified communication platform for UH Mānoa. Includes login and sign-up options for students, faculty, and verified clubs, as well as a brief tour of key features.
Home Page – Displays a TikTok-style vertical feed featuring official announcements, event promotions, polls, and daily campus updates. Only verified faculty and club accounts can post, while all users can like, comment, and share.
Chat Page – Provides multiple communication options, including live chats and club chats, threaded discussion posts, and private message groups. Supports real-time messaging and topic-based channels for organized conversation.
Events Page – Lists all upcoming university and club events with options to RSVP, purchase tickets, and check in using QR codes. Includes filters for event type, date, and organizer, as well as “Happening Now” highlights for ongoing activities.
Classes & Clubs Page – Serves as a dedicated space for collaboration and community. Each class or club has its own hub with channels for announcements, discussions, polls, and shared resources. Verified leaders and faculty can manage membership and posts.
Profile Page – Allows users to customize their personal information, manage notification preferences, view attended events, and track engagement across classes and clubs. Faculty and club leaders have additional verification and management options.
Admin Dashboard – Enables authorized administrators to oversee platform operations, manage user verification, review reported content, and maintain the overall integrity of the ManoaNet ecosystem.
Use cases ideas:
New User:
 A new user visits the ManoaNet landing page, logs in using their verified UH Mānoa email address, and sets up a personal profile. Based on selected interests and hobbies, the user is automatically recommended relevant discussion forums, classes, and clubs to join.
User:
 The user logs in and is directed to the Home page, where they scroll through the TikTok-style feed to view the day’s campus announcements and polls. Afterward, they open the Classes tab to check their Physics class section for any new updates, then close the app.
User and event:
 The user logs in and begins scrolling through the Home feed. They encounter a short video promoting an upcoming concert near campus. After clicking the link, they are redirected to the Events tab for full details. The user purchases a ticket directly through the app and, upon arriving at the venue, opens the Events tab again to display their QR code for check-in.
Club Promotion:
 A verified club leader opens the app, is directed to the Home page, and presses the “Create” button to make a new media post. They upload a short video promoting their organization and an upcoming club event. Once posted, the video appears on the Home feed for all verified users to view and interact with.
Admin:
 An administrator logs into ManoaNet and accesses the Admin Dashboard. They review pending verification requests from new clubs, check recent user activity, and moderate flagged posts for inappropriate content. After approving new club registrations, they log out, ensuring that the platform remains safe and organized for all users.
