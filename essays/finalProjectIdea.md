## Overview

### The Problem
Communication within universities like UH Mānoa is often lacking and messy. Students, faculty, and clubs rely on various platforms, such as email, Discord, Instagram, and word-of-mouth—to share announcements, organize events, and create activities. Constantly checking each platform becomes tedious and inconsistent.  

As a result, students frequently miss important updates or struggle to stay involved with the university community. There is no unified space where official campus updates, social engagement, and student discussions coexist.

### The Solution
**ManoaNow** is an all-in-one campus communication and engagement platform that connects students, clubs, classes, and faculty through a verified university network.

The platform enables users to:
- **Stay informed** with official announcements and daily updates  
- **Communicate** through live chats and discussion posts  
- **Promote and discover events**  
- **Collaborate** in class and club spaces  
- **Manage personal activity** through customized profiles

## Approach

The application will create a **verified social ecosystem** exclusive to each university.  
Students, faculty, and clubs can join via official school emails to ensure verification and trust.

## Use Case Ideas

### New User
A new user visits the *ManoaNow* landing page, logs in using their verified UH Mānoa email address, and sets up a personal profile. Based on selected interests and hobbies, the user is automatically recommended relevant discussion forums, classes, and clubs to join.

### Daily Routine
The user logs in and is directed to the Home page, where they scroll through the feed to view the day’s campus announcements and polls.  
Afterward, they open the **Classes tab** to check their Physics class section for updates, then close the app.

### Event Discovery
The user logs in and begins scrolling through the Home feed. They encounter a short video promoting an upcoming concert near campus. After clicking the link, they are redirected to the **Events tab** for full details. The user purchases a ticket directly through the app and, upon arriving at the venue, opens the Events tab again to display their QR code for check-in.

### Club Promotion
A verified club leader opens the app, is directed to the Home page, and presses the **“Create”** button to make a new media post. They upload a short video promoting their organization and an upcoming club event. Once posted, the video appears on the Home feed for all verified users to view and interact with.

### Admin Oversight
An administrator logs into *ManoaNow* and accesses the **Admin Dashboard**. They review pending verification requests from new clubs, check recent user activity, and moderate flagged posts for inappropriate content. After approving new club registrations, they log out, ensuring that the platform remains safe and organized for all users.
