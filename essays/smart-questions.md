## Smart Questions
Asking smart questions are very important. It demonstrates respect for the responder and increases the likelihood of receiving actual helpful responses. A smart question is essentially built on three fundamentals:

1) Research: Before even asking the question, research and look for resources.
2) Context: Provide a clear, complete picture of your environment, what you're trying to do, what you've already tried, and the exact error or unexpected behavior you're encountering.
3) Precision: Be specific and concise. State your goal clearly, and ask a direct question that guides experts toward the gap in your understanding.

## Example of a Good Question:

"URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8318911/why-does-html-think-chucknorris-is-a-color"

Before asking the question, the person researches about there problems and tests it through coding. As a result, he receives a valid and useful reponse which answers his question.

## Bad Question
Now, a bad question is one that essentially wastes time. In the example below, generated by ChatGPT, the title is emotional and uninformative, no research was done prehand, and it's overall lazy and incomplete.

## Conclusion
Essentially, "There is no such thing as a stupid question" is meant to encourage curiosity, but it is not a license for laziness. Learning to ask a smart question is the first and most crucial step in solving any technical problem. It forces you to clarify your own thinking and research. It also demonstrates to experts that you are a learner worthy of their time and effort. By investing effort into your question through research, clear communication, and precise detail, you invest in the quality of the answer you will receive.
