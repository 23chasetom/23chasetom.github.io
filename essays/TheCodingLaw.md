## Coding Standards
The practice of coding standards in programming, and in particular software engineering is essential in every way. I would compare coding standards to road signs and markings, in the aspect that they both direct and give crucial information to the user. Elements such as formatting and naming conventions act as road signs, keeping the code organized and understandable for more than just the writer. And even more importantly, commenting and documentation act as markings, telling the user what is what and how a thing functions. Fundamentally, coding standards are programming laws, which keep the peace among the many diverse languages and programmers. Without these laws, it would be as chaotic as driving on a road with no markings; users would create programs with the sole intent of completion with no clarity.  
This analogy raises a critical question: Can these coding standards, these "laws" actually help in learning a programming language? Coding standards provide a structured path, which, by enforcing consistent patterns, such as naming a variable, placing brackets, or when to use a particular function, monotonize the task of programming. As a result, these patterns help coders memorize them, turning conscious effort into an automatic skill, building foundation and habit.

## ESLint
My use of ESLint in VSCode so far has been almost entirely positive. As mentioned in the previous section, coding standards, and the maintaining of them, is essential in programming. So, having a tool such as ESLint available at all times improves my practice by margins. It keeps code consistent and helps identify errors. But its integration with VSCode elevates it from a simple error-checker to an active learning partner. Instead of waiting to run a program to discover a syntax error, ESLint highlights issues as I type. This instant feedback is invaluable for reinforcing correct patterns and breaking bad habits.  
However, this begs the question: Is getting rid of ESLint errors painful, useful, or both? Initially, the process was like a jumpscare. My screen is filled with errors, and a wave of red underlines fill my screen. Fixing such errors is tedious, but it must be done. Yet, these highlighted errors are what make ESLint helpful. It teaches coders, such as myself, the proper way to write code and how to adhere to the coding standard.  
In conclusion, coding standards are a fundamental tool for mastery. Through the lens of ESLint and VSCode, we see that enforced standards provide a scaffold for learning, offering real-time, contextual feedback that accelerates a programmer's understanding of a language. The journey from being overwhelmed by errors to writing error-free code is a journey from tedious to familiarity. It is a challenging path, often frustrating at the moment, but ultimately indispensable.
