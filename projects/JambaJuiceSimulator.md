## The Jamba Juicer
I engineered a Jamba Juice Simulator in TypeScript to replicate the end-to-end workflow of Jamba Juice. The application features a dynamic menu system, a customer order interface, and a core inventory management component that tracks ingredients in real-time. The system is built with scalability in mind, allowing for new menu items to be added seamlessly. A key feature is the pre-fulfillment inventory check, which prevents orders from being placed if sufficient ingredients are unavailable, mirroring a critical real-world business operation.

## Learned
This project was a deep dive into practical TypeScript and software design. I moved beyond writing simple scripts and learned to structure a complete, object-oriented system. This approach taught me how to create flexible and expandable code, making it easy to add new features later. Most importantly, I learned the value of modular designâ€”breaking down a large problem into smaller, well-defined classes made the code clearer, easier to debug, and more efficient to write.
